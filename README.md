### This is a web application using Django REST framework + React for powerline visulization, with data provided by GIRS @UCLA.

(Planned to be finished within 5 days during school visit, but other factors (computer hardware, getting covid...) affacted the development process. )

Stages of development: 

1. Preparing for the backend: learning Django, getting the data ready, etc. 
2. Preparing for the frontend: reviewing React components.
3. Backend development: building the database, models, and views with Django, creating endpoints for the frontend to call.
4. Frontend development: coding the logics and components. 
5. Integration and deployment: integrating the seperated backend and frontend, learning and deploying on AWS EC2.

To be improved: 
1. A more detailed Gantt chart can be used, divide the whole task and conquer the smaller tasks. Can be devided even more. 
2.
